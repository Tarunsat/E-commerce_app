# E-Commerce App

Welcome to the E-Commerce App! This is an early project I made to showcase an e-commerce application utilizing a SQL database. The app allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and complete purchases.

## Features

- Product catalog: Browse through a wide range of products conveniently organized into categories.
- Shopping cart: Add products to your cart and manage quantities before proceeding to checkout.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android device running Android OS version 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher.


## Usage

1. Launch the E-Commerce App on your Android device.
2. Browse through the product catalog to find items of interest.
3. Add desired items to your shopping cart.
4. Review your cart, adjust quantities if needed, and proceed to checkout.


## Contributing

This is an early project, and contributions are not currently being accepted. However, you're welcome to fork the repository and modify the app according to your needs.


## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the Android community for their resources and support.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the app. Although it is an early project, it serves as a starting point for building an e-commerce application with a SQL database backend.
